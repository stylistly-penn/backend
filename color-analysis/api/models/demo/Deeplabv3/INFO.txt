Running DeepLab with Ray gives this error:
ValueError: The actor ImplicitFunc is too large (154 MiB > FUNCTION_SIZE_ERROR_THRESHOLD=95 MiB). Check that its
definition is not implicitly capturing a large array or other object in scope. Tip: use ray.put() to put large
objects in the Ray object store.

In order to avoid this behaviour, look for the environment variable FUNCTION_SIZE_ERROR_THRESHOLD in the Ray library
folder. For example: \lib\site-packages\ray\_private\ray_constants.py

Change the FUNCTION_SIZE_ERROR_THRESHOLD default value from 10**8 to 160*(1024)**2 so that from 95Mb the limit goes to 160Mb.
